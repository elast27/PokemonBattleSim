# PokemonBattleSim
A functional representation of a battle in the core Pokemon games

Fully functional with minimal data choices. Select your Pokemon through Engine.java by adding them to the Pair in the return statement. First Pokemon is yours, second is the opponent.

UI is still in progress, as well as more data and options. Codebase is constantly evolving. Feel free to email me at eric.l.last@gmail.com to inquire more about the project
